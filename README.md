For my project, I made a game of Jeopardy. The theme is hip-hop.
I have questions about Albums, culture, technology, individual artists, and groups.
The first thing you can do is click on a button with a point value. A question will
appear along with options for an answer. If you enter the correct answer, then the 
scoreboard will increase by the corresponding points. If you enter the wrong answer,
then your score will decrease by that value. I used HTML to group all of my buttons
into divs. The buttons are used for the click event from javascript. I then added a 
function that prompted you to ask the questions in the game. Next, I added an if -else 
function to determine whether or not the answer is correct. In that, there is also
a function to determine what your score will be at that point. If you click on the header,
the game will restart from zero points again.

Some of my unsolved problems included the disable button. The functions I tried
to use to disable my buttons once clicked, threw off the other functions I had
in place. Another challenge I had was deciding how the user can win the game.

The biggest improvement I could make is to write drier code and find a more efficient
way to impliment my functions. I would also, add the disable button, and have the game
restart once you've won or lost.
